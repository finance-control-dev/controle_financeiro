# Financial Control - Flutter App

This is a complete Flutter project, structured with **Clean Architecture** principles and **Provider** state management.

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL SETUP REQUIRED**
> 
> The `android/` and `ios/` folders are generated by your local Flutter SDK.
> **You MUST run the `setup.bat` script immediately to create them.**
>
> 1. Double-click `setup.bat` in this folder.
> 2. It will auto-detect your Flutter installation and run `flutter create .`.
> 3. After it finishes, the `android` and `ios` folders will appear.
